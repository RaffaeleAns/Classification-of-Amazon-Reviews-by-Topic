# Classification-of-Amazon-Reviews-by-Topic
The aim of this project is to explore the potential of text mining and machine learning techniques. Specifically, a multiclass text classification problem has been addressed.


The project is developed on Python 3 and uses the following libraries:

- Pandas
- Numpy
- json
- gzip 
- matplotlib
- wordcloud
- GDP
- king
- nltk
- scipy
- sklearn
- time
- urllib


If one or more of the previous libraries are not installed and you want to run the project locally, you need to install them via terminal (for example, on a Mac: <<pip install "library name" >>).


The datasets used are downloaded directly into the notebook thanks to the "urllib" library. It is necessary that the computer is connected to the internet.


For a correct execution of the project it is recommended to run the notebook (project.ipynb) on Google Colab, so you don't have to install any library.
